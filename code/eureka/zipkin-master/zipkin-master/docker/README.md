## zipkin Docker images
This directory contains assets used to build and release Zipkin's Docker images.

## Production images
The only Zipkin production images built here:
* openzipkin/zipkin: The core server image that hosts the Zipkin UI, Api and Collector features.
* openzipkin/zipkin-slim: The stripped server image that hosts the Zipkin UI and Api features, but only supports in-memory or Elasticsearch storage with HTTP or gRPC span collectors.

## Testing images

We also provide a number images that are not for production, rather to simplify demos and
integration tests. We designed these to be small and start easily. We did this by re-using the same
base layer `openzipkin/zipkin`, and setting up schema where relevant.

* [openzipkin/zipkin-cassandra](storage/cassandra/README.md) - runs Cassandra initialized with Zipkin's schema
* [openzipkin/zipkin-elasticsearch6](storage/elasticsearch6/README.md) - runs Elasticsearch 6.x
* [openzipkin/zipkin-elasticsearch7](storage/elasticsearch7/README.md) - runs Elasticsearch 7.x
* [openzipkin/zipkin-kafka](collector/kafka/README.md) - runs both Kafka+ZooKeeper
* [openzipkin/zipkin-mysql](storage/mysql/README.md) - runs MySQL initialized with Zipkin's schema
* [openzipkin/zipkin-ui](lens/README.md) - serves the (Lens) UI directly with NGINX

## Getting started

Zipkin has no dependencies, for example you can run an in-memory zipkin server like so:
`docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim`

See the ui at (docker ip):9411

In the ui - click zipkin-server, then click "Find Traces".

We also provide [example compose files](examples/README.md) that integrate collectors and storage,
such as Kafka or Elasticsearch.

## Configuration
Configuration is via environment variables, defined by [zipkin-server](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-server/README.md). Notably, you'll want to look at the `STORAGE_TYPE` environment variables, which
include "cassandra", "mysql" and "elasticsearch".

Note: the `openzipkin/zipkin-slim` image only supports "elasticsearch" storage. To use other storage types, you must use the main image `openzipkin/zipkin`.

When in docker, the following environment variables also apply

* `JAVA_OPTS`: Use to set java arguments, such as heap size or trust store location.
* `STORAGE_PORT_9042_TCP_ADDR` -- A Cassandra node listening on port 9042. This
  environment variable is typically set by linking a container running
  `zipkin-cassandra` as "storage" when you start the container.
* `STORAGE_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR` -- A MySQL node listening on port 3306. This
  environment variable is typically set by linking a container running
  `zipkin-mysql` as "storage" when you start the container.
* `STORAGE_PORT_9200_TCP_ADDR` -- An Elasticsearch node listening on port 9200. This
  environment variable is typically set by linking a container running
  `zipkin-elasticsearch` as "storage" when you start the container. This is ignored
  when `ES_HOSTS` or `ES_AWS_DOMAIN` are set.
* `KAFKA_PORT_2181_TCP_ADDR` -- A zookeeper node listening on port 2181. This
  environment variable is typically set by linking a container running
  `zipkin-kafka` as "kafka" when you start the container.

For example, to add debug logging, set JAVA_OPTS as shown in our [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) file:
```yaml
      - JAVA_OPTS=-Dlogging.level.zipkin=DEBUG -Dlogging.level.zipkin2=DEBUG
```

## Runtime user
The `openzipkin/zipkin` and `openzipkin/zipkin-slim` images run under a nologin
user named 'zipkin' with a home directory of '/zipkin'. As this is a distroless
image, you won't find many utilities installed, but you can browse contents
with a shell like below:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /busybox/sh openzipkin/zipkin
/zipkin $ ls
BOOT-INF  META-INF  org       run.sh
```

## Notes

If using an external MySQL server or image, ensure schema and other parameters match the [docs](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-storage/mysql-v1#applying-the-schema).

## Building images

To build `openzipkin/zipkin`, from the top level of the repository, run:

```bash
$ docker build -t openzipkin/zipkin:test -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

If you want the slim distribution instead, run:

```bash
$ docker build -t openzipkin/zipkin-slim:test -f docker/Dockerfile . --target zipkin-slim
```
